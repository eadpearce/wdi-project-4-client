# WDI-Project 4: ColLAB

ColLAB is a site for writing and requesting fanfiction based on something in fandom called an 'anon meme'. Anon memes tended to start as a journal post on blogging sites such as Livejournal or Dreamwidth and the requests (prompts) and fanfiction (fills) were made anonymously in the comments. This way everything is made in the comments section - there is no set way to differentiate between prompts, fills and regular comments, which gets confusing and hard to moderate very quickly. I wanted to create a site that allowed users to do this kind of collaboration easily in a purpose-built site. All posts can be searched by tags, author, content rating, date posted, and whether a writing prompt has been filled or not. 

Ruby on Rails and AngularJS. Posts, comments and user profiles support markdown using a front-end markdown parser.
